While HTML is quite an easy language to learn, it is very limited on what it can achieve on itâ€™s own. Web Pages that use plain HTML would just look like a plain text document, but by using HTML along with CSS we can create web pages that have a more user friendly UI. However, anyone who has used HTML and CSS to build a website before knows that it is a pain to get the website to look exactly how you want. For example, if you want to center a div box inside another div box, you would have to mess with many of the CSS properties, such as the position and z-index. A big part of HTML and CSS is to manipulate div boxes to create a grid-like menu, and it is a very time consuming task to get each item to the place you have envisioned in your mind.

UI framework is basically a bunch of HTML,CSS and JavaScript presets that make building and maintaining a website much more simple. In Semantic UI, we can give predefined properties to objects by invoking the desired properties in its class name. Structures such as grids can be made much easier using the predefined properties. Even when the predefined structures do not suit your taste, you can always override the properties in the CSS file.

By using UI frameworks such as Semantic UI, web developers can save a lot of time and effort when creating a user friendly and attractive website that is suited to their needs. This is evident by the outrageous cost of $29.99 a month to learn Semantic UI on Pluralsight. It is way too time consuming to build a webpage from the ground up using pure HTML and CSS, employers rather pay for the employees to learn and use UI frameworks to save labor and time. This makes financial sense when you also have to update and maintain your webpage that could potentially earn you more business.
