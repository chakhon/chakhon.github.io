## Overview

Problem: Student mental health in higher education has been an increasing concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected everybody, causing a lot of pressure, uneasiness, despondency, and inner issues for the understudies alongside their companions and their family.

Solution: We propose to create a mental health chat bot that can give students ease and comfort. Making therapy and relief accessible to all. It will be a safe space where people can openly express themselves without fear of judgment.

## Approach

We want to help students reach out during the COVID-19 pandemic and to cope with the distressing issues they are facing. Students will use the site to vent/talk about their day. To accomplish this, our site would suggest a daily topic and users could discuss and share their thoughts around the topic for the day.

## What I Learned

This is the first project where I worked in a organization on GitHub, which gave me an opportunity learn and use many features on GitHub, such as pull requests and issues. This is also the first computer science project where I had to work with more than two person, so it was a very interesting experience to manage and share work among four persons. I also learned how to deploy a Meteor application using Meteor Up and monitor the application using Monti APM.
