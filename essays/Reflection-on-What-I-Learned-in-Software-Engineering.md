I learn many skills through out this class, and I could see myself using them in the future. Skills such as Coding Standards, User Interface Frameworks and Agile Project Management was extremely useful in the final project. The final project really help reinforce some of those skills, and I feel that the project gave us a glimpse what real world Software Engineering is like. It allow us to use and apply these skills in particular:

## Coding Standards

Coding Standards might seem like a small and insignificant thing at first, it forces you to put a space here and there, you have to use '' instead of "". It seems so annoying and it forces you to go back to change some code, and it might even prevent you from solving a problem in a certain way. But coding standards quickly becomes an amazing tool when you start work with someone else codes. It makes sure that everyone is coding in the same style, even if you solve the problems in a different way, and you can quickly understand someone else code using their comment and names. In short Coding Standards makes sure that everyone is using the same proper grammar, and gives you less of a headache when you are working with a team.

## User Interface Frameworks

We worked really hard on the to make sure that our web page looks good, and some time it is a pain to try to get a certain component to look a certain way and that was with UI Frameworks. I cannot imagine the time and work we would have to put in if we were using pure HTML and CSS. UI Frameworks give us a easy way to implement UI components without spending too much time to alter its look and function. These preconfigured UI elements have features and options built into them, so developers can spend more time on other parts of the project.

## Agile Project Management

The form of Agile Project Management we learn and used in this class is called issue driven project management. It functioned really well in our final project, since it acted as a simple to-do list that allows us to identify issues and problems, and it also shows who is working on what, which make it really effective for project management. Thanks to it's GitHub integration we can manage the project board along with the project itself on the same platform, we can quickly keep track of what is been done on what branch and who is working on it. The milestones ensures that progress has been made, and that the project is deliverable on time.
