Dice' N Monsters is a game I made with my friend Yiwen for our final project in ICS 111. The game is heavily inspired by Pokemon and Dungeon and Dragon.

In the game, the player can choose to play as a knight,viking or monk, each of them look different and has different stats. The objective to defeat as many enemy as possible. The instruction page bellow shows the rule and control of the game.

I developed the randomly generated tile map for the game using a series of for loops to write characters to a text file with different characters representing a different tile, and then it reads the text file to render the map. In order to make the map look nice I used a switch statement to check the previous tile that was generated to increase the chance of the next tile being the same type.
